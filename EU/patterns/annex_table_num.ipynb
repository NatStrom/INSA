The High Representative also declared that the Union does not and will never recognise those illegal sham ‘referenda’ and their falsified outcome, nor any decision taken on the basis of this outcome, and urged all Members of the United Nations to do the same. By organising those illegal sham ‘referenda’, Russia aimed to change by force the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine, which constitutes a clear and serious breach of the Charter of the United Nations (the ‘UN Charter’). The High Representative also indicated that all those involved in organising those illegal sham ‘referenda’ as well as those responsible for other violations of international law in Ukraine will be held accountable and that additional restrictive measures against Russia will be brought forward in this regard. The High Representative recalled that the Union remains unwavering in its support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders, and demands that Russia immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its troops and military equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine. The High Representative further declared that the Union and its Member States will continue to support Ukraine’s efforts to this end, as long as necessary.</p>\n",

By wilfully undermining the rules-based international order and blatantly violating the fundamental rights of Ukraine to independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, core principles as enshrined in the UN Charter and international law, Russia is putting global security at risk. The members of the European Council stated that they do not and will never recognise the illegal ‘referenda’ that Russia has engineered as a pretext for this further violation of Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, nor their falsified and illegal results. They declared that they will never recognise the illegal annexation, that those decisions are null and void and cannot produce any legal effect whatsoever and that Crimea, Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia are Ukraine. They called on all States and international organisations to unequivocally reject the illegal annexation and recalled that Ukraine is exercising its legitimate right to defend itself against the Russian aggression to regain full control of its territory and has the right to liberate occupied territories within its internationally recognised borders. The members of the European Council stated that they will strengthen the Union’s restrictive measures countering Russia’s illegal actions and further increase pressure on Russia to end its war of aggression.</p>\n",

He is a member of the so-called Izborsk Club, a Russian Conservative think tank which specializes in studying Russia’s foreign and domestic policy. Dugin has ideologically and theologically justified Crimea’s annexation and Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, seeing it as a “liberation” of Ukraine from Western influence. Dugin’s ideology is centered on the idea of building a totalitarian, Russia-dominated Eurasian empire, which includes Ukraine for historical, religious and geographical reasons. Dugin’s ideological assumption is that Ukraine is an artificial state threatening the security of Russia and the envisioned Eurasian Empire. Therefore the military invasion of Ukraine was inevitable. He called on President Vladimir Putin to militarily invade eastern Ukraine. Dugin has promoted the Russian World concept linked to the expansive, revanchist nationalism of the Putin era, entailing the idea of the historic motherland protecting the subjects of the Russian World. He has helped to revive the concept of “Novorossiya” or “New Russia” — a historical name, used during the era of the Russian Empire for an administrative area that is currently part of Ukraine. Dugin called on the denazification of\\xa0Ukraine and called its government fascist. He actively supported the pro-Russian separatist movement in Eastern Ukraine and instrumentalised his worldview theory by establishing the “Eurasian Youth Union”, which was undertaking activities directed at undermining the sovereignty of Ukraine.

He is a member of the so-called Izborsk Club, a Russian Conservative think tank which specializes in studying Russia\\u2019s foreign and domestic policy. Dugin has ideologically and theologically justified Crimea\\u2019s annexation and Russia\\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine, seeing it as a \\u201cliberation\\u201d of Ukraine from Western influence. Dugin\\u2019s ideology is centered on the idea of building a totalitarian, Russia-dominated Eurasian empire, which includes Ukraine for historical, religious and geographical reasons. Dugin\\u2019s ideological assumption is that Ukraine is an artificial state threatening the security of Russia and the envisioned Eurasian Empire. Therefore the military invasion of Ukraine was inevitable. He called on President Vladimir Putin to militarily invade eastern Ukraine. Dugin has promoted the Russian World concept linked to the expansive, revanchist nationalism of the Putin era, entailing the idea of the historic motherland protecting the subjects of the Russian World. He has helped to revive the concept of \\u201cNovorossiya\\u201d or \\u201cNew Russia\\u201d \\u2014 a historical name, used during the era of the Russian Empire for an administrative area that is currently part of Ukraine. Dugin called on the denazification of\\u00a0Ukraine and called its government fascist. He actively supported the pro-Russian separatist movement in Eastern Ukraine and instrumentalised his worldview theory by establishing the \\u201cEurasian Youth Union\\u201d, which was undertaking activities directed at undermining the sovereignty of Ukraine. Therefore Aleksander Dugin is responsible for, supporting and implementing actions or policies which undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, or stability or security in Ukraine.\",\n",
