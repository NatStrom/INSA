In his position as Prosecutor General, he supervises the Prosecutorâs Offices in the Russian Federation, the Special Prosecutorâs Offices and the Military Prosecutorâs Office. In his capacity as Prosecutor General, he is responsible for serious human rights violations, including the arbitrary detentions of protesters, and for widespread and systematic repression of freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, and freedom of opinion and expression.</p>\n",

Moreover, the Prosecutor Generalâs Office demanded that the Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Communications (Roskomnadzor) restrict access to opposition websites and social network accounts that contained information on planned gatherings of Alexei Navalnyâs supporters. OnÂ 29Â JanuaryÂ 2021, the Prosecutor Generalâs Office once again demanded that Roskomnadzor restrict access to opposition websites and social network accounts, this time ahead of the pro-Navalny protests onÂ 30 andÂ 31Â JanuaryÂ 2021. Warnings were sent to internet companies (Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, Google, Mail.ru Group). The Prosecutor Generalâs Office also announced that those taking part in the demonstrations would be prosecuted.</p>\n",

Despite the fact that his conviction in that case had been found arbitrary and unfair by the European Court of Human Rights inÂ 2018, Alexei Navalny was arrested upon his arrival at Moscow airport on 17Â January 2021.</p>\n",
