    "*The historic files are not structured but in the format of press releases that have a date assigned. One step could be to load each date and its assigned conent as a nested Json/ list. Another possible solution or the next step is, to use regular expression functions to match ans search for context that can then be assigned as a value to a specific key. \n",
    "I have absolutely no idea how to automate that or to ensure, that the lines are not split but the information belonging to one entity is connected to each other. Furthermore, most updates do not provide an Entity ID. I can work on it, but its gonna take some time*\n",
