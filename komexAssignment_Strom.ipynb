    "*This Assignment contains code from my project related work on individual targeted Sanctions at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies. The task is, to extract data on individual targeted Sanctions, specifically Individual Sanctions by the US Government that are found on the Specially Designated Nationals list by the Office of Foreign Asset Controls (OFAC). The Assignment will demonstrate my skills in both accessing the data from an external provider via url as well as extracting information from text files for the year 2023. Step 2 might take some time to load. The Assignment is structured as follows*:\n",
